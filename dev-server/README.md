## putts.io-dev-server
Just a development server for `putts.io`.

Added `.env`-file to repo because I use connection string from there. You shouldn't never do this but to make things easier this is fine.

### usage
Use `docker-compose up --build` or without `--build` to run development server, database server and database management tool (Adminer - https://github.com/vrana/adminer).

Created just to try out
* Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Knex.js (http://knexjs.org/)
* Objection.js (https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/)
* PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/)
* etc.

TODO:
* Add swagger (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node)
