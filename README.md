## putts.io-client
React & Redux app that is going to be a Progressive Web App at some point of it's lifecycle. And for now it's "mobile only"-app. We'll see if we need to refactor it to be more responsive ie. tablet, desktop, etc.

### development
Basic stuff. `git clone`, `yarn install`, etc.

### usage
At the moment `Login`-button will write "JWT-token" to localstorage and let the user in.
