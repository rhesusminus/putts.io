# putts.io-client
React & Redux app that is going to be a Progressive Web App at some point of it's lifecycle. And for now it's "mobile only"-app. We'll see if we need to refactor it to be more responsive ie. tablet, desktop, etc. Trust me. It's not pretty in desktop or tablet :-)

## development
Basic stuff. `git clone`, `npm install`, etc.

We use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as a development server. Data is in `dev-server`-folder. And for the port is `3090`. Script `npm run dev-server` starts a developmen server.
